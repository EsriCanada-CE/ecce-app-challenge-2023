Being in this program allowed me to combine both my passions in geography and computer science, making it an incredibly fulfilling field to study and work in. My most recent experience includes working as a Geospatial Analyst which has been a fantastic opportunity to apply my technical expertise in a real-world setting. I was able to use the skills I learned to manage and update map layers, create detailed and accurate visualizations of spatial data, and utilizing geospatial technologies to automate data analysis and process workflows. In my free time, I enjoy reading books and playing video games, as well as spending quality time with my family and friends.<br style="clear:both;" />

I have been involved in various geography competitions at a national level during high school, events which furthered my passion for the field of geography. I am interested in how various natural phenomena can impact human systems and the relationships between human and environmental forces. In my free time, I enjoy playing video games and participating in trivia events with friends.<br style="clear:both;" />
