## Our Mission Statement

The anthropogenic impacts facing our planet today are compounding at an exponential rate, threatening the biodiversity of our ecosystems and the survival of our green spaces. With this in mind, it is essential that we consider the environmental state of natural spaces around us and remain aware of the habitats within our communities.

While throughout human history most people lived in smaller communities, there has been a significant shift towards urbanization in recent years. As of 2007, more people live in urban areas than rural areas, and this trend is projected to increase, with 68% of people estimated to live in urban areas by 2050. As the world continues to urbanize, a larger focus must be placed on urban ecology in order to preserve the natural beauty around us and enrich our well-being. Ecology is vital to human health and urban green spaces provide many benefits such as improving air quality, reducing noise, and enhancing biodiversity. Therefore, it is essential for humans and wildlife to find a way to coexist as our world rapidly expands.

Hamilton, Ontario, one of the most highly industrialized areas in Canada, is also known as the waterfall capital of the world. It is home to over one hundred waterfalls, more than most urban areas its size. However, as urbanization sprawls and industries continue developing, the ecology of these natural landmarks is becoming damaged or disappearing altogether. Maintaining urban ecology requires dedication, effort, and the willingness to remain knowledgeable of threats to local wildlife. 

The purpose of HikeSMART Hamilton is to increase awareness of the city's nature as well as to promote the sustainable use and conservation of nearby trails. With this app, users will be able to view details about nature trails in Hamilton, Ontario, in correlation to nearby Environmentally Sensitive Areas (ESA). ESAs are areas that include natural features or have a significant number of ecological functions. Not only will this app provide users with a localized database of hiking trails in Hamilton, but also allow them to gain insight into the city's ecological essentials so that users can be more aware and appreciative of the space they are in while also being further educated on important trail etiquette.

## How Does it Work?

HikeSMART Hamilton is an app that provides users with a localized database of beautiful hiking trails to explore within the city as well as location-specific environmental concerns so that users can be more aware and appreciative of the space they are in. This user-friendly app allows people to easily plan their hikes in Hamilton all while being aware of the ecology around them. In order to use the app to the fullest, make sure to check out all of these features!

*Display Upon Opening*

When HikeSMART Hamilton is first opened, the user will be greeted by a splash page that provides an introduction to the app and how to get started. Once this is exited out of, a map of Hamilton appears that displays three layers: trails, waterfalls, and environmentally sensitive areas within the city. Users will immediately see areas that have a higher density of natural spaces, and can focus in on various locations.

*Location and Distance Buffer*

The top left of the map contains an address search bar in which the user can input any location. Note that they can also click "use current location" in the splash page. Directly below the search bar, there is a slider in which the user can select a search radius anywhere from 0 km to 20 km. Once a location is specified, a circle will appear indicating all the trails, waterfalls, and ESAs that are within a certain distance.

*Filter*

The filter button directly to the right of the address search bar allows the user to select certain features or areas to customize their experience. By clicking this button two options initially show up: city waterfalls and trails. By clicking their respective dropdowns, specific features can be checked on and off, including waterfalls, cascades, and five of Hamilton's most popular trails. This allows the app to be easily personalized and customized depending on the type of hike the user is looking for.

*Bookmarks*

By clicking the bookmark icon to the right of the page, five bookmarked environmentally sensitive areas appear: Iroquoia Heights Conservation Area, Red Hill Creek Escarpment Valley, Hamilton Escarpment, Hamilton Harbour, and Felker's Falls Escarpment Valley. Clicking on any of these will zoom in on their location. From there, clicking on any nearby access road will drop a point, and details about each waterfall can be found under results to the left, such as name, location, and how to access it. This information can also be accessed at any point by clicking the waterfall icons on the map itself. Each layer can be toggled on and off to provide a focus on certain aspects of the app by clicking the layer icon on the bottom right of the screen.

*StoryMap*

For more information about the bookmarked locations, the user can press the waterfall icon located at the top left corner of the app. This takes the user to an ArcGIS StoryMap with more information about Hamilton's five most popular natural areas. In addition, it includes useful hiking tips and tricks at the end that should be followed in order to hike responsibly and protect the environment.
