**Mission Statement**

"To help wildlife thrive, by being the voice for the biodiversity around us."

**Introduction**

During the COVID-19 pandemic, the government of Nova Scotia began creating campaigns to encourage migrants to move and work in Canada’s Ocean Playground (Chisholm, 2021). Remote workers were attracted to the safety of rural living, its simplicity, and cheaper, more affordable housing. This influx of migrants created a need to develop more infrastructure, whether it was renovating old housing, improving local roads, or creating completely new structures on undeveloped lands.

How is this increase in infrastructure affecting our backyard neighbours? What wildlife, watersheds, forests are being affected and manipulated to accommodate our growing needs?

The 2022 census from Statistics Canada showed Sydney, Cape Breton has seen a 2.6% increase in population over the course of 5 years. During the global Covid 19 pandemic, people left the hustle and bustle of the big cities and moved to quieter areas, attracted to the safety of rural living, the simplicity, and in Cape Breton’s case, cheaper, more affordable housing. The 2022 census confirms Nova Scotia saw a 2.8% population growth, with Cape Breton County making it into the top four of highest increase.

As population rises, the need for housing rises. How can we visualize and understand the effects of urban growth on the ecological backdrop? How does your new home, and this growth and development affect the wide range of habitats Cape Breton has to offer?

**Applications**

*SceneViewer*

The 3D scene represents the potential impact of infrastructure development on biodiversity in Cape Breton County and Victoria County. Fragmented habitats, disrupted migration routes, reduced food and water availability, and increased risk of collisions with vehicles are all potential consequences of such development. It is crucial to conduct impact assessments before any infrastructure development to evaluate the potential impact on the natural habitat and its species, as habitat fragmentation has been identified as a significant cause of biodiversity loss (Fahrig, 2003).

The city of Sydney serves as an example of the imbalanced relationship between infrastructure and protected areas, as the city's development has led to ongoing ecological effects, including habitat fragmentation and loss, and increased mortality rates due to collisions with vehicles (Forman & Alexander, 1998). Also, Sydney's location, with plenty of exits to different bodies of water, can be a barrier for different species in the area. These studies emphasize the importance of evaluating the impact of infrastructure on biodiversity and implementing measures to mitigate negative effects on the environment.

*Web Experience*

The [EnviroAdvocate App](https://experience.arcgis.com/experience/37c7dc901dbd423dbdb27cd58c204fd2) consolidates natural resource data and allows individuals to search and visualize what is surrounding them in the environment. The goal is by being aware of what surrounds them, habitat destruction is prevented or reduced. The app does this by providing an easy, user-friendly interface and ample information altogether.

Biodiversity is crucial to variability in the environment, and with habitat loss to bring in new infrastructure, we risk losing wildlife, old growth forests and more to urban growth. By respecting the wildlife around us, we can develop and grow communities while working to protect biodiversity.

Homepage

The home page provides a summary of the app and its purpose. At the top of the header, there is a menu that will take someone to individual pages of the app, each providing different visual information.

Special Habitats

On this page, users can see two maps. The map on the left contains data from the Government of Nova Scotia, Department of Natural Resources, and all registered civic addresses. The wider the view, the clusters are shown, and the pop-ups indicate how many features are in the clusters.

As the user zooms in, the clusters get smaller until each individual address is shown.

The map on the right contains data on special habitats in Cape Breton. The purpose is for a user to search their location on the left map, and the map on the right will zoom to the same area.

Natural Resources

This map features multiple layers of natural resources. The further the view, the geology layer displays. Users can select different polygons for formation information and age. Zooming in, the geology layer view disappears, and multiple layers are displayed. This includes old growth forests, streams, special habitats, aquaculture, and indigenous communities.

Users can explore the map, use the legend to display or hide layers, and see where they are in relation to multiple types of natural resources.

Properties for Sale’

This is a 3D web scene. Using the specific features of the web scene view, a user can use the two widgets on the left to toggle and adjust their view.

Click pan ![](./images/pan.JPG) and use the mouse button to drag the scene to a view of your choice.

Click rotate ![](./images/rotate.JPG) and click the mouse while dragging the scene in the direction you want to rotate and tilt.

Use the legend on the right to adjust which layers are in view. Click the legend icon and in the layers tab, click the eyeball to hide or show certain layers. Customize your views by doing this and gather unique data.

Survey

This page is intended for the user to enter information on properties for sale. When an address is added, the location is pinned on the map. This will gather information on property and development locations.
