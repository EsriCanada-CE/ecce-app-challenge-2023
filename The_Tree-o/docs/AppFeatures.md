# App Features
## TReecorder Mobile
- Allows members of the public to access information about trees near them, including the species name, whether it is native or non-native, links to information about that species (e.g. on the Ontario Tree Atlas), and the diameter at breast height (DBH) of that tree.
- Allows members of the public to report damage to trees, such as broken branches, trees on power lines, etc., making arbourists aware of this damage more quickly.
- Allows members of the public to report wildlife sightings associated with trees, giving people an opportunity to connect with nature while simultaneously improving understanding of urban ecosystems and how animals use urban forests for food, habitat, and other purposes

## TReecorder Web
- The “Urban Forest Profile” page allows planners to view multiple layers depicting urban forest density, diversity, native vs. non-native species, and species at risk. This allows them to make informed decisions associated with managing and planning their community’s urban forest so that communities can enjoy the benefits of a healthy, diverse, native, and climate-resilient urban forest.
- The “Damage Reports'' and “Wildlife Reports” pages allow arbourists to view damage and wildlife reports submitted by members of the public, and zoom to the tree associated with each report. This enables them to respond more quickly to tree damage incidents and better understand how wildlife is using certain street trees.

## Python Notebooks
- The ingestion script allows GIS professionals to quickly make most municipal tree points datasets TReecorder-compatible, enabling them to get the most out of their tree points data
- The biodiversity tessellation script allows GIS professionals to quickly calculate biodiversity metrics for their urban forest, including species richness and the Shannon-Wiener index
