I am a former gold medalist at the International Geography Olympiad, and I am a fellow of the Royal Canadian Geographical Society. My areas of interest include geography and GIS education, coastal geomorphology, and digital humanities, and I enjoy applying my GIS and web/app development skills to these areas. Some of my projects include www.geoworkshops.ca, a free repository of geography-related workshops and resources for high school students and teachers, and atlas.digitalhistory.ca, a digital atlas that showcases historical photographs, videos, maps, and buildings from across Canada.<br style="clear:both;" />
