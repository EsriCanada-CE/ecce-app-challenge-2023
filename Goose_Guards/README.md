## Team Bios:
### Matthew Ketchin:
Matthew is a first-year Master's student in the department of Geography and Environment at the University of Western Ontario and is a member of the Geospatial Analysis Lab. He graduated from the University of Calgary with a degree in Ecology and a minor in Geography. His research interests center around the spatial and temporal analysis of big data in environmental health applications. 
### Milad Malekzadeh:
Milad is a Ph.D. candidate in GIS (Geographic Information System) at the Department of Geography and Environment, University of Western Ontario, Canada. He is currently working on his thesis on Context-Aware Human Mobility Analysis Using Multi-Source Data and Machine Learning. His research interests include geospatial analysis, artificial intelligence and machine learning, network analysis, big data, movement analysis, and context-aware systems. Milad is a member of The Canadian Association of Geographers (CAG) and The American Association of Geographers (AAG). Furthermore, he has chaired the International Student Committee in the Department of Geography and Environment at Western University and is a member of the Integrated Transportation Community Advisory Committee in the City of London, Ontario. Milad is also a member of Reforest London, a non-profit organization to enhance environmental and human health in the Forest City.
### Steffen Shaigec:
Steffen is a second-year MSc student in the Department of Geography and Environment. He is developing a mobile, ground-based, high-resolution remote sensing system using Light Detection and Ranging (LiDAR) technology to document the detailed urban built and vegetated surface structure. Steffen is a lead member of Western's CubeSat Science team, which is designing a small remote-sensing satellite for launch from the International Space Station. Steffen's interests include all things related to sustainability, space, and entrepreneurship within Low Earth orbit.

## Goose Guards Mission Statement:
Our mission is to establish a crowd-sourced approach towards promoting a harmonious coexistence between human populations and urban wildlife, particularly the Canada Geese population on the Western University campus. Through community engagement, we aim to identify and address the negative impacts of geese behaviour on campus infrastructure and human safety, while protecting the well-being of the geese and their habitat. In addition, we endeavour to cultivate a shared sense of responsibility regarding the importance of urban wildlife conservation, empowering individuals and groups to take responsible action toward this goal. Our GEMINI (GEese MIght Not be nIce) dashboard serves as a tool to facilitate community participation in this endeavour.
## Characteristics of the App:
The purpose of a crowd-sourced GIS data collection app that allows users to georeference the location of goose-human interactions is to facilitate the collection and management of data related to the behaviour of Canada geese on the Western University campus. This data can then be analyzed to gain insights into the spatial distribution of geese, patterns of goose-human interactions, and the impact of geese on campus infrastructure and human safety.

The data collected can be used as a tool by campus grounds staff to better protect goose nesting sites and limit the human impact on the geese, reducing the number of negative interactions or attacks with geese on campus. The app can provide real-time information about goose activity and nesting locations, allowing for targeted interventions to protect these areas. Grounds staff can use this information to adjust their practices to minimize the impact on the geese, such as modifying mowing schedules or installing barriers to protect nesting sites.

In the context of conservation and protected areas, the data can also help in the management and conservation of the geese population and their habitat. It can provide insights into the impact of human activity on the geese and their environment, and help in the development of strategies to mitigate negative effects.

In the context of urban ecology, the data can inform decisions related to the design and management of urban landscapes. For example, the data may suggest the need for changes in the design of infrastructure to minimize negative impacts on geese and their habitat. It can also help to raise awareness and engage the community in conservation efforts, fostering a sense of shared responsibility and participation in conservation efforts.

Overall, a crowd-sourced GIS data collection app that allows users to georeference the location of goose-human interactions can serve as a powerful tool for collecting and analyzing data related to the behaviour of Canada geese and their interactions with human populations, informing decisions related to conservation and urban ecology, and providing critical information for campus grounds staff to take proactive steps to protect the geese and their habitat.

### GEMINI Dashboard Data Input
To input data into the GEMINI (GEese MIght Not be nIce) dashboard, users have three options:
1.	Launch the ESRI storymap that explains the rationale for creating the GEMINI Dashboard and input data through the integrated dashboard.
2.	Desktop users, input data directly into the GEMINI Dashboard.
3.	Moble users, input data via the Survey123 Submission Portal.

To input information, follow the input prompts under the “Geese Momentary Information” panel:
1.	Select the type of incident:
    - Attack
    - Nesting
    - Presence
    - Other
2.	Provide the date and time of the incident.
3.	Select the location on the map by tapping or clicking on the interactive map, which will automatically drop a pin in the location.
4.	Specify the number of geese involved in the incident or sighting.
5.	Optionally, upload a photo of the geese themselves or the area in which the geese/nest occupied to provide a better spatial understanding of the interaction and improve mitigation options.
6.	Provide an optional description of the incident, including:
    - The nature in which the user interacted with the geese.
    - The distance at which the user experienced the interaction.
    - The activity the user was performing at the time (walking past/commuting, using the space recreationally, or just minding their own business).

After providing the requested information to the Survey123 powered “Geese Momentary Information” panel, the user can tap or click on submit. Once the submission is received, the user will see their contribution appear in the GEMINI dashboard.
