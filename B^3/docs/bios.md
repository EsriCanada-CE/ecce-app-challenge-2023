**Bay Berry:** Bay graduated from Dalhousie University in 2020 with a BSc in Earth Sciences. Her masters research at the Université du Québec à Rimouski investigates wintertime coastal erosion on the North Shore of the St Lawrence Estuary and the impacts of warm, icefoot-free winters. Bay's PhD research with the Dalhousie Coastal Hydrology Lab focuses on numerical modeling of permafrost coastal dynamics, combining terrestrial and oceanographic processes to simulate permafrost coastal erosion under current and future climate conditions.

**Nicolas Beauchamp:** Nicolas is the GIS Intern with the Dalhousie University Killam Memorial Library and a recent graduate from the Department of Earth and Environmental Sciences. When not geeking out on John Nelson YouTube videos you can find him foraging for music in his local record shoppe.

**Beau Ahrens:** Beau is a PhD Candidate in the Interdisciplinary PhD program at Dalhousie University in Halifax Nova Scotia, under Dr. Daniel Rainham. After completing his BA and MSc at the University of Guelph in Geography, focusing on GIS and Spatial Analysis techniques and theory. He now works on various projects studying the relationships between a person’s environment and their health and wellbeing. In his PhD research, Beau seeks to leverage spatial analysis and remote sensing techniques to understand the optimal tree and greenspace characteristics in promote good health in our cities. Beau has more recently moved to Calgary, to find new outdoor adventures for himself and his two dogs (Pixie and Kobe).
