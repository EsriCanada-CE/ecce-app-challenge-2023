# Green/Blue Space Accessibility in Halifax

https://green-space-accessibility-halifax-dalspatial.hub.arcgis.com

## Mission statement
Green spaces and blue spaces are increasingly recognized as critical features of urban environments. These therapeutic landscapes are shown to increase exercise, promote socialization, and improve mental and physical health and well-being in older adults. This critical ecosystem service is fundamental to healthy aging. Older adults often struggle with accessibility due to limited physical mobility. Fear of falling is cited as the most significant barrier to walking in older adults, and may results in altered route selection, or trip cancellation. Improper access to these areas may result in social isolation, ceasing physical activity and increasing rates of depression. 

The orientation and condition of the built environment are determinants in walking ability and decision in older adults. Among many cited build environment conditions that impact walking to a destination, sidewalk slope and walking distance are typically most commonly discussed. Slopes that are higher than 5% rise may present increased challenge to walking, with 10% or greater acting as an absolute barrier to mobility limited older adults. This is especially true during winter months, where high slopes coupled with poor weather may result in total isolation of older adults. Halifax, Bedford, and Dartmouth have areas without sidewalks, and many sidewalks that are at extreme slope. Older adults living in areas with disconnected sidewalks or extreme slopes may not be able to traverse the environment to access green and blue spaces. 

Older adults also explain that walking distances act as major barriers to ability to traverse a landscape. Distances over 100m with a rest stop (I.e., benches) may act as an absolute barrier to walking. As the study site does not have distributed rest stops throughout, the extreme walking distances coupled with sloped sidewalks means that many older adults (especially those that are financially vulnerable) are not able to walk to a green space or blue space destination. These individuals may rely on bus stops for accessibility. Unfortunately, bus stop distribution is not equal throughout the city, nor is sidewalk access to the bus stops. 

This web app presents vital information for communities and community planners to identify vulnerable populations and vulnerable areas, which may have limited access to green and blue spaces. With a rapidly ageing population, and among the highest proportion of seniors in Canada, Nova Scotian urban locations must address the inequitable access to natural areas offering critical therapeutic ecosystem services.

## App description
The "Green/Blue Space Accessibility in Halifax" app is an information tool designed to inform users of challenges for accessing greenspaces and blue spaces for older adults in Halifax, Dartmouth, and Bedford Nova Scotia. Greenspaces and blue spaces are often termed therapeutic landscapes as they promote exercise as well as better mental health and well-being. The app is presented as an ArcGIS Hub site in four pages: overview, demographics, benefits, and accessibility. Interactive thematic maps present the location of blue spaces (ponds, lakes, rivers) as well as public green spaces throughout the study site. Sidewalk slope walkability is presented as are bus stops. Percentage of older adults (65+) are presented for the past 3 census years at the dissemination area level. Economic deprivation measures are presented as they may suggest dependency on walking or public transit as a primary means of accessing resources. This tool can be used to identify areas that are at a higher risk of isolation from therapeutic landscapes for older adults.

## Goals
-	Show spatial relationships between green spaces, pedestrian accessibility, and age/economic dependency demographics in around Halifax, Nova Scotia.
-	Present general information about the health benefits of improving access to green spaces, particularly to older adults.
