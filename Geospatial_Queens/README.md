<h2> Team Mission Statement </h2>

  With the rise of food prices due to the pandemic, many Canadians have resorted to examining alternatives options to traditional grocery shopping such as home food gardening. In September 2020, 51% of Canadians reported that they grew at least one vegetable or fruit at home with one out of five gardeners new to home food production in 2020 (Music et al., 2022). Growing food allows individuals to have control over their food sources and it can be a great way to reduce your overall carbon emissions. To examine the shift in home gardening an interdisciplinary study done in the Agri-food analytics lab at Dalhousie University uses GIS and crowdsourcing to collect data on home gardening in Nova Scotia (Lal, 2020). 

We have created an app that builds on this research and makes it easier for people in Halifax, Nova Scotia, to take part in producing their own food. Using satellite imagery from Landsat 8, LIDAR and soil type data from the municipality we were able to find variables such as soil type, soil moisture, surface temperature and sunlight to create a suitability index for the ideal areas to produce the most common vegetable and fruits in the Maritimes. 


<h2> Statement of Characteristics of the app HaliGrow </h2>

HaliGrow is a web app that allows users to identify which vegetables and fruits are likely to be most successful when grown under the conditions of their personal gardens. Through the “search for address” function, users can find their homes and easily identify which foods they can grow through our suitability analysis layer. HaliGrow also appeals to those without outdoor space or who are looking to get more involved with their community by including a layer that shows locations of community gardens within the Halifax Regional Municipality (HRM). Sometimes, it can be challenging to begin a home garden when you aren’t sure where to start. HaliGrow offers a user-friendly platform that gives people regional advice based on their specific environmental factors and microclimate. HaliGrow was made to support the HaliGrownians in their urban gardening endeavours, a decision that benefits the people, the profits, and the planet.
