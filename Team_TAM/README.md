## Fairy Creek Old Growth Forest GeoHub 

We created an informative GeoHub website that offers detailed maps, figures and statistics on the sustainability of harvesting old-growth forests in the Fairy Creek watershed of Vancouver Island, British Columbia. By providing important data and information about the ecological and economic impacts of old-growth forest harvesting, the website assists users in making informed decisions about conservation and resource management. Whether you're a concerned citizen, an activist, or just someone who wants to learn more about the importance of old-growth forests, our website has everything you need to get started.

## Mission Statement

Fairy Creek is a region on Vancouver Island in British Columbia, Canada, where there have been ongoing protests and blockades since the summer of 2020. Environmental activists are protesting the logging of old-growth forests in the region, arguing that they are ecologically important and are critical for the enviroment. Activists have set up camps and used various tactics to prevent logging companies from accessing the area, leading to clashes with the police, including arrests and the use of force to clear blockades. The conflict between activists and logging companies highlights the ongoing tension between environmental conservation and resource extraction in Canada and has drawn attention from both local and international media.

Old-growth forests in British Columbia, including those in the Fairy Creek watershed, are important for several reasons. These forests are ecologically diverse and provide critical habitat for endangered species. They also play a crucial role in mitigating climate change by storing carbon and regulating the water cycle. Additionally, old-growth forests are important cultural sites for Indigenous communities and provide recreational opportunities for visitors. The decline of these forests by 30% since the 1990s highlights the urgent need for conservation and sustainable management practices.

Our GeoHub website offers a comprehensive platform that provides maps exploring the sustainability of harvesting old-growth forests in British Columbia's Fairy Creek watershed. Our website features detailed maps that utilize Site Index data, which is considered to be the gold standard measurement of forest productivity, to assess the sustainability of harvesting old-growth forests. The maps also highlight the endangered species in the watershed, providing valuable information about the biodiversity of the area. Additionally, the website displays the carbon storage potential of the trees in the area, helping users understand the role that old-growth and younger-growth trees play in mitigating climate change. Through this website, users can access important data and information about the ecological impacts of old-growth forest harvesting, helping them make informed decisions about conservation and resource management. Overall, our website is an essential tool for anyone interested in understanding the unique and valuable ecosystems of the Fairy Creek watershed.

## GeoHub Description/Pages

### Home

Our home page is the perfect starting point within our Geohub. We provide a brief overview of the conflict between protesters and logging companies, as well as information on the actions taken by the government and other stakeholders. In addition, our home page introduces the purpose of our web applications, which can help you stay informed and engaged with the issue. To make it easy for you to access all the necessary information, we've included shortcuts to these apps at the bottom of the page.

### About Fairy Creek

In this page, we will take an in-depth look at the background of Fairy Creek, examining why this old-growth forest has become such an important issue. We will explore the key points that summarize the significance of Fairy Creek and provide an overview map of TFL46 and the Fairy Creek watershed. Additionally, we will delve into the relationship between the Pacheedaht First Nations and the territory that includes Fairy Creek.

### Webapp 1: Site Productivity 

Our first web app explores 2 elements within the Fairy Creek watershed, a highly productive ecosystem and large mature trees. Site Index is a measurement of forest productivity and is considered the gold standard. It measures how much a re-planted forest stand will grow over a set number of years based on site-specific ecosystem characteristics. In the Fairy Creek watershed, site productivity was determined by collecting Site Index point features for specific tree species. Considerations about the consequences of harvesting trees in Fairy Creek are also discussed using the presented data.

### Webapp 2: Carbon Storage

On page 4 we created an app that compares the rate of carbon sequestration with the age of trees. Using data in the Fairy creek area, we found some strong correlations that are crucial for maintaining ecological balance and mitigating climate change.  Old-growth forests, such as those in British Columbia's Fairy Creek watershed, play a crucial role in carbon sequestration because they can store more carbon relative to their size, and they have a significant capacity to store carbon, making them important in maintaining the planet's ecological balance. Our research in the Fairy Creek area focused on classifying trees based on their age into four categories: Young, Mid, Mature, and Old. Old-growth trees have a greater capacity to store carbon, while younger trees absorb more carbon overall, and their carbon absorption rate accelerates as they age. The rate of carbon absorption is crucially linked to the age of the forest, with older forests playing a critical role in mitigating climate change.

### Webapp 3: Species at Risk

On page 5, we have a map displaying the distribution of species at risk in the Fairy Creek watershed. Old growth forests are critical for maintaining biodiversity and providing habitats for a wide range of species. They contain unique and complex ecosystems that provide a home for many endangered and rare species, including birds, mammals, and insects. These forests also offer critical ecosystem services, such as carbon sequestration, clean air and water, and soil stabilization. Some of the species we focused on were the Brachyramphus marmoratus (Marbled Murrelet), Megascops kennicotti kennicotti (Western Screech Owl) and Rana aurora (Northern Red-legged frog).

###  Data/Literature

On page 6, we have created a comprehensive page containing all the data and information sources we utilized in developing our web apps and written content. In our research, we relied on a diverse range of sources, including iMapBC, which proved to be a valuable resource for discovering open-source data on forest management, old growth trees, and harvestable areas.
