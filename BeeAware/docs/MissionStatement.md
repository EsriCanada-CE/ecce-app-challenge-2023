# BeeAwareâ€™s Mission Statement 

Our mission is to support bees and other urban pollinators by empowering Toronto residents to get involved with private and public pollinator garden projects.

Bees and other pollinators like butterflies, moths, and beetles play crucial roles in urban ecology. Their activities support plant life and vegetation, which in turn provide aesthetic and economic value, temperature moderation, wildlife habitats, food production, and a wide variety of other benefits to cities (1). Toronto is home to over 400 species of pollinators (2), but, as is the case throughout the world, bees and other pollinators are in decline.1 While the causes of and solutions to this decline are complex, one way that Toronto residents can support local pollinator populations is by planting a pollinator garden with native plants that attract, feed, and shelter them.
